A convenient and simple user interface provides easy navigation through all necessary data processing steps. At each processing step, overview plots are produced to make controlling by an experienced user more convenient. These plots can be saved in PNG and CSV formats or summarized within a single report. The parameter of the processing steps can be controlled through a user-friendly graphical interface. The complexity of this interface can be adjusted accordingly to the user’s expertise level. Users can upload data and metadata, standardize Raman spectral data and construct various machine learning models including deep learning for Raman spectroscopic data. Afterwards, these classification or regression models can be applied to test data sets, which can be unlabeled.")],-1)]))}const l=t(i,[["render",s]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/documentation/","title":"Introduction","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1652106283000,"contributors":[{"name":"Darina laptop","username":"","email":"darina.storozhuk@uni-jena.de","commits":2},{"name":"Claudia Kröckel","username":"","email":"claudia.kroeckel@bpd.gmbh","commits":3}],"changelog":[{"hash":"0bc021c9648f11abc9d2f8cb0b8cb5d4013e236c","time":1652106283000,"email":"claudia.kroeckel@bpd.gmbh","author":"Claudia Kröckel","message":"Upload New File"},{"hash":"6e69ed161829c44f4c565dcb205f4a9df571109b","time":1643982846000,"email":"claudia.kroeckel@bpd.gmbh","author":"Claudia Kröckel","message":"Update Tutorial.md"},{"hash":"df3ced57321d3191a34b749334af9626bbdc618f","time":1643317298000,"email":"darina.storozhuk@uni-jena.de","author":"Darina laptop","message":"try with ts"},{"hash":"d34cb42dd6e3eb0074008e9807e7537fb0157e22","time":1643189451000,"email":"claudia.kroeckel@bpd.gmbh","author":"Claudia Kröckel","message":"Update Tutorial.md"},{"hash":"acc45ae8bef16382aaf145a18bbc6eccc2a15be7","time":1642956934000,"email":"darina.storozhuk@uni-jena.de","author":"Darina laptop","message":"correct order"}]},"filePathRelative":"documentation/README.md"}');export{l as comp,m as data};
